 * üìò Product Summary ‚Äì XMT1000 Ultrasonic Flow Transmitter (Baker Hughes)
 * Format: Technical Concept in C-Style Comment Block
 *
 * üß† Working Principle:
 *   // XMT1000 operates on the "Transit-Time Ultrasonic" method.
 *   // Two transducers send sound pulses through flowing liquid ‚Äî one downstream,
 *   // one upstream. Due to fluid movement, the downstream pulse travels faster.
 *   // The time difference between upstream and downstream pulses is used to
 *   // calculate the flow velocity accurately.

 * üî¨ Formula Used:
 *   // Flow rate Q is computed using:
 *   // Q = K * (t_up - t_down) / (t_up * t_down)
 *   // where:
 *   //   t_up     = upstream transit time
 *   //   t_down   = downstream transit time
 *   //   K        = calibration constant (based on pipe dimensions & fluid)

 * üì¶ Key Product Features:
 *   // - Non-intrusive ultrasonic measurement (no moving parts)
 *   // - Available in 1, 2, or 3 channel configurations
 *   // - Mounting: local or remote

 *   // industrial environments, offering smart diagnostics, reliable
 *   // performance, and long-term stability.

 * üîä XMT1000 Ultrasonic Flow Transmitter ‚Äì Sound Pulse Type
 *
 * üß† Principle:
 *   // The XMT1000 uses ultrasonic sound pulses based on the "transit-time" method.
 *   // These are high-frequency acoustic waves transmitted through the liquid.
 *   // The pulses are generated by piezoelectric transducers mounted on the pipe.

 * üîç Pulse Characteristics:
 *   // - Type: Ultrasonic acoustic pulses
 *   // - Frequency: Typically 0.5 MHz, 1 MHz, or 2 MHz depending on transducer model
 *   // - Shape: Short bursts of sine waves (tone bursts), not continuous signals
 *   // - Direction: Sent both upstream and downstream to measure time difference

 * üì¶ Transducer Models:
 *   // - C-RS, C-PT, C-ET series transducers
 *   // - Frequency selection depends on pipe size, fluid type, and installation method
 *   // - Higher frequencies offer better resolution; lower frequencies penetrate thicker pipes

 * ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:
 *   // Each transducer alternates between transmitting and receiving pulses.
 *   // The system measures how long it takes for the pulse to travel through the fluid.
 *   // Flowing liquid causes a time difference between upstream and downstream pulses.
 *   // This time shift is used to calculate flow velocity.

 * ‚úÖ Summary:
 *   // The XMT1000 uses short, high-frequency ultrasonic tone bursts
 *   // (typically 0.5‚Äì2 MHz) to measure liquid flow via transit-time differences.
 *   // These pulses are clean, directional, and optimized for industrial pipe conditions.

 * üìò Safety Integrity Levels (SIL) ‚Äì SIL1 vs SIL2 vs SIL3 Certification
 * Standard: IEC 61508 / IEC 61511 | Purpose: Risk Reduction in Safety Systems
 *
 * üß† What is SIL?
 *   // SIL (Safety Integrity Level) defines the reliability of a safety function.
 *   // It measures how effectively a system reduces risk of dangerous failure.
 *   // SIL levels range from SIL1 (basic) to SIL4 (highest), with SIL3 being very strict.

 * üî¢ SIL Levels ‚Äì Risk Reduction & Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD)

 *   SIL1:
 *     // PFD: 0.1 to 0.01 ‚Üí 1 failure in 10 to 100 operations
 *     // Risk Reduction Factor (RRF): 10 to 100
 *     // Used in low-risk systems (e.g., basic alarms, non-critical shutdowns)

 *   SIL2:
 *     // PFD: 0.01 to 0.001 ‚Üí 1 failure in 100 to 1,000 operations
 *     // RRF: 100 to 1,000
 *     // Suitable for moderate-risk systems (e.g., emergency shutdowns, fire detection)

 *   SIL3:
 *     // PFD: 0.001 to 0.0001 ‚Üí 1 failure in 1,000 to 10,000 operations
 *     // RRF: 1,000 to 10,000
 *     // Required for high-risk systems (e.g., toxic release prevention, explosion control)

 * ‚öôÔ∏è Certification Differences

 *   SIL1:
 *     // Basic fault tolerance, minimal redundancy
 *     // Lower cost, simpler design and testing

 *   SIL2:
 *     // Requires stricter design, validation, and documentation
 *     // Often includes redundancy and diagnostics

 *   SIL3:
 *     // Demands rigorous analysis, testing, and third-party certification
 *     // May require redundant systems and fail-safe architecture
 *     // Higher cost and complexity

 * üè≠ Industry Use Cases

 *   SIL1 ‚Üí HVAC systems, building automation
 *   SIL2 ‚Üí Chemical processing, pharmaceuticals, power generation
 *   SIL3 ‚Üí Oil & gas, nuclear, aerospace, petrochemicals

 * ‚úÖ Summary:
 *   // SIL1, SIL2, and SIL3 represent increasing levels of safety assurance.
 *   // Higher SIL = lower probability of failure + stricter design/testing.
 *   // Selection depends on risk assessment and potential consequences of failure.

/*Product Perspective

The concept of the new XMT1000 is a multi-core universal platform. It will support broad range of Liquid and future Gas flow measurements. 
It distributes the functions into different modules:
FLOW BOARD (Measurement Process Unit): Sensor drive, signal acquisition and restricted communication capabilities. 
There will be two hardware releases, Non-SIL version and SIL version. 
The hardware design will be identical, but Non-SIL version will not have Safe Output components populated.
The two versions of FLOW BOARDS will have same firmware but we need to add SIL board to make SIL meter.

MAIN BOARD: Acquire flow information from Flow Board and displaying in field. 
It will also play the administrator role for the measurement system. 
It will automatically detect function boards and configure software based on hardware configurations.

OPTION BOARD: Several option boards will be available for different measurement configurations. 
For initial release, the default OPTION BOARD will be a HART BOARD with HART communication abilities. 
A wide range of industrial communication protocols will be supported through different flavor OPTION BOARDs. 

IO OPTION: IO option boards will also be available. 
These boards will support RTD temperature sensors and provide analog input/output.
FLOW BOARD can work in stand-alone mode as shown in Figure 1. 
Either of the MPU can be connected to MAIN BOARD to form the full function XMT1000 flow meter as Figure 
2. The stand-alone working mode can be used as debugging and diagnose purpose.
