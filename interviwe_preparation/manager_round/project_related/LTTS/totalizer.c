 * 📘 Flowmeter Totalizer – Data Gathering, Working, and Saving Mechanism
 *
 * 🧠 What Does a Totalizer Do?
 *   // A totalizer continuously collects flow rate data from a flowmeter
 *   // and integrates it over time to calculate the **total volume or mass**
 *   // of fluid that has passed through the system.

 * 🔄 Data Gathering Process:
 *   // 1. Flowmeter measures instantaneous flow rate (e.g., liters/min).
 *   // 2. Totalizer samples this rate at fixed intervals (e.g., every second).
 *   // 3. It uses integration logic to accumulate total flow:
 *      Total_Flow += Flow_Rate × Time_Interval

 * 🧪 Example:
 *   // If Flow_Rate = 10 L/min and Time_Interval = 1 min,
 *   // then Total_Flow += 10 liters

 * 💾 Data Saving Mechanism:
 *   // - Totalizer stores accumulated flow in non-volatile memory (EEPROM or Flash)
 *   // - This ensures data is retained even after power loss or reset
 *   // - Some systems log data periodically (e.g., every hour/day) for audit or billing

 * 🔐 Safety & Accuracy:
 *   // - Uses high-precision data types (e.g., double/float) to avoid rounding errors
 *   // - Implements error detection (e.g., pulse loss alarms, checksum validation)
 *   // - May include watchdog timers and redundant counters for reliability

 * 🧰 Hardware Integration:
 *   // - Flowmeter sends pulses or analog signals to totalizer
 *   // - Microcontroller or PLC reads input and performs math
 *   // - Display shows real-time total flow and may allow manual reset

 * 📦 Applications:
 *   // - Water treatment plants
 *   // - Fuel dispensing systems
 *   // - Chemical dosing
 *   // - Industrial batch processing

 * ✅ Summary:
 *   // A totalizer gathers flow data by sampling rate over time,
 *   // integrates it mathematically, and stores the result in memory.
 *   // It provides cumulative flow tracking for monitoring, control, and reporting.
