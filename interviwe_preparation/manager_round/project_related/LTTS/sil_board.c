/******************************************************************************
 * 🛡️ SIL Board Integration – Functional Safety in Flowmeter Project
 * Certification Level: SIL3 | Standard: IEC 61508 / IEC 61511
 ******************************************************************************/

/* 🎯 Purpose of SIL Board:
 *   // A dedicated Safety Integrity Level (SIL) board is used to monitor and
 *   // control critical safety functions in the flowmeter system.
 *   // Ensures compliance with SIL3 requirements for high-risk industrial applications.
 */

/* 🔧 Role in System Architecture:

 *   - Monitors flow data and system health independently
 *   - Validates totalizer logic and EEPROM integrity
 *   - Triggers safe shutdown or alerts on fault detection
 *   - Interfaces with SAM9260 and BF534 boards via isolated communication

 *   Example:
 *     if (flowRate > threshold || EEPROM error detected):
 *         triggerSafeShutdown();
 *         logFaultToSILBoard();
 */

/* 🧠 SIL Board Features:

 *   - Redundant microcontroller or FPGA logic
 *   - Watchdog timers and CRC validation
 *   - Isolated I/O for safe signal handling
 *   - Diagnostic coverage > 90% (per FMEDA analysis)
 *   - Complies with hardware fault tolerance (HFT) requirements

 *   Safety Functions:
 *     - Flow limit enforcement
 *     - EEPROM corruption detection
 *     - Command validation (e.g., RESET, STOP)
 *     - Emergency shutdown signaling
 */

/* 📋 Certification Process (via XSIDA):

 *   - Safety lifecycle documentation
 *   - FMEDA and fault injection testing
 *   - Independent audit of SIL board logic
 *   - Verified compliance with IEC 61508 Part 2 & 3

 *   Outcome:
 *     - SIL3 certificate issued for entire flowmeter system
 *     - SIL board validated as core safety component
 */

/* ✅ Summary:

 *   // The SIL board acts as a safety guardian for the flowmeter system.
 *   // It ensures that even in case of hardware/software failure,
 *   // the system enters a safe state and protects against hazardous conditions.
