 * 🚀 Real-World Bug Fix – Firmware Optimization at Radix Electro Systems
 *
 * 🛠️ Scenario:
 *   // Problem: Device booting was slow (5–6 seconds)
 *   // Task: Optimize boot performance within 6 days
 *   // Platform: STM32 microcontroller running at 8 MHz
 *   // Interface: EEPROM accessed via I²C (100 kHz bus speed)
 *
 * 🔍 Analysis:
 *   // During boot, the firmware reads ~2000 bytes from EEPROM.
 *   // Original code used byte-by-byte read:
 *      -> For each byte: I²C START → Address → Memory Pointer → Data → STOP
 *      -> Introduced repeated START/STOP cycles, causing protocol overhead
 *      -> EEPROM was capable of sequential read (confirmed via datasheet)
 *
 * ⚡ Solution:
 *   // Rewrote EEPROM read logic using I²C sequential access:
 *      -> Used a single I²C START condition
 *      -> Set memory pointer once
 *      -> Read full 2000 bytes in one continuous stream
 *      -> Finalized with a single STOP condition
 *   // STM32 Code Example:
 *      HAL_I2C_Mem_Read(&hi2c1, EEPROM_ADDR, start_addr,
 *                       I2C_MEMADD_SIZE_16BIT, data_buffer, 2000, TIMEOUT);
 *
 * ⏱️ Technical Reason for Time Reduction (8 MHz STM32):
 *   // I²C at 100 kHz transfers ~1 byte every 100 µs
 *   // Byte-by-byte method adds ~1.2 ms delay per transaction due to:
 *      -> Software overhead from HAL-level API (START/STOP handling)
 *      -> CPU wait times, interrupt latency, and bus arbitration
 *   // 2000 bytes × ~1.2 ms ≈ ~2.4 seconds boot delay
 *
 *   // Sequential read eliminates most overhead:
 *      -> Only one START and one STOP used
 *      -> EEPROM auto-increments internal address pointer
 *      -> Continuous transfer with ACK/NACK feedback loop
 *   // Actual transfer time reduced to ~200–300 ms total
 *   // Boot time improved by 2–3 seconds — validated on real hardware
 *
 * ✅ Impact:
 *   // Delivered optimized firmware well before deadline
 *   // Reduced boot time significantly
 *   // Improved user experience and device responsiveness
 *   // Demonstrated understanding of protocols, datasheet usage, and STM32 internals
