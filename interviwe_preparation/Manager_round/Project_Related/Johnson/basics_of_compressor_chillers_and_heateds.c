/* COMPRESSOR
   Definition:
   A compressor is a mechanical device that increases the pressure of a gas
   by reducing its volume, commonly used in refrigeration, HVAC, and pneumatic systems.

   Main Parts:
   - Motor: Powers the compressor
   - Piston or Rotors: Compress the gas (depending on type)
   - Cylinder: Chamber where compression occurs
   - Valves: Control gas intake and discharge
   - Intercooler: Cools compressed gas between stages
   - Crankshaft and Connecting Rods: Convert rotary motion to linear (in piston types)

   Working Principle:
   Based on Boyle’s Law – when gas volume decreases, pressure increases.
   The compressor draws in low-pressure gas, compresses it mechanically,
   and discharges it at high pressure for use or storage.

/* CHILLER
   Definition:
   A chiller is a machine that removes heat from a liquid (usually water)
   through a refrigeration cycle, producing chilled water for cooling buildings or equipment.

   Main Parts:
   - Compressor: Circulates refrigerant and raises its pressure
   - Condenser: Releases heat from refrigerant to air or water
   - Expansion Valve: Reduces refrigerant pressure before entering evaporator
   - Evaporator: Absorbs heat from water, cooling it
   - Control Panel: Manages system operation
   - Water Box: Distributes chilled water to the building

   Working Principle:
   The refrigerant absorbs heat from water in the evaporator,
   is compressed and sent to the condenser where it releases heat,
   then expands and returns to the evaporator to repeat the cycle.

/* HEATER
   Definition:
   A heater is a device that converts energy (electricity, gas, or fuel)
   into heat to warm air, liquids, or surfaces.

   Main Parts:
   - Heating Element: Converts electrical energy into heat (e.g., nichrome wire)
   - Thermostat: Controls temperature
   - Blower/Fan: Distributes heated air (in space heaters)
   - Housing: Encloses components safely
   - Safety Switches: Prevent overheating or electrical faults

   Working Principle:
   Electricity flows through the heating element, which resists the current
   and generates heat (Joule heating). The heat is transferred to air or liquid
   and distributed to the surrounding area.
