 * Modbus Communication Protocol - Detailed Explanation
 *
 * Definition:
 * Modbus is an industrial serial communication protocol developed in 1979 by Modicon.
 * It is widely used for communication between automation devices such as PLCs, sensors, and controllers.
 *
 * Characteristics:
 * - Uses a master-slave architecture.
 * - Supports serial (Modbus RTU, Modbus ASCII) and Ethernet (Modbus TCP) communication.
 * - Simple and efficient protocol for industrial automation.
 *
 * Modbus Communication Types:
 * 1. Modbus RTU - Binary format, efficient for serial communication.
 * 2. Modbus ASCII - Human-readable format, used in older systems.
 * 3. Modbus TCP - Uses Ethernet for faster communication.
 *
 * Modbus Frame Structure:
 * - Address Field: Identifies the slave device.
 * - Function Code: Specifies the operation (read/write).
 * - Data Field: Contains the requested data.
 * - CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check): Ensures data integrity.
 *
 * Function Codes:
 * - 01: Read Coils
 * - 02: Read Discrete Inputs
 * - 03: Read Holding Registers
 * - 04: Read Input Registers
 * - 05: Write Single Coil
 * - 06: Write Single Register
 * - 15: Write Multiple Coils
 * - 16: Write Multiple Registers
 *
 * Advantages:
 * - Open protocol, widely supported in industrial automation.
 * - Simple implementation with minimal overhead.
 * - Supports multiple devices on a single network.
 *
 * Limitations:
 * - No built-in security features.
 * - Limited error handling compared to modern protocols.
 * - Requires proper addressing and timing for reliable communication.
 *
 * Applications:
 * - Industrial automation and control systems.
 * - SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition).
 * - Communication between sensors, actuators, and controllers.
 *
 * Summary:
 * Modbus remains a widely used protocol in industrial automation due to its simplicity and reliability.
 * Proper implementation ensures efficient data exchange between devices.
