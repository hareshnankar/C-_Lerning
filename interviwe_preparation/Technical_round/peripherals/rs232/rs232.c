 * RS232 Serial Communication Protocol - Detailed Explanation
 *
 * Definition:
 * RS232 is a standard protocol for serial communication between Data Terminal Equipment (DTE)
 * and Data Communication Equipment (DCE). It is widely used for connecting computers, modems,
 * and other serial devices.
 *
 * Characteristics:
 * - Uses asynchronous serial communication.
 * - Supports full-duplex transmission (simultaneous send and receive).
 * - Defined by voltage levels, baud rate, and handshaking signals.
 *
 * Electrical Specifications:
 * - Logic HIGH (Mark) = -3V to -15V
 * - Logic LOW (Space) = +3V to +15V
 * - Baud rates range from 300 bps to 115200 bps.
 * - Maximum cable length: ~15 meters (50 feet).
 *
 * Pin Configuration (DB9 Connector):
 * 1. DCD (Data Carrier Detect)
 * 2. RXD (Receive Data)
 * 3. TXD (Transmit Data)
 * 4. DTR (Data Terminal Ready)
 * 5. GND (Ground)
 * 6. DSR (Data Set Ready)
 * 7. RTS (Request to Send)
 * 8. CTS (Clear to Send)
 * 9. RI (Ring Indicator)
 *
 * Handshaking Mechanisms:
 * - No Handshaking: Direct data transmission without flow control.
 * - Hardware Handshaking: Uses RTS/CTS signals for flow control.
 * - Software Handshaking: Uses XON/XOFF characters for flow control.
 *
 * Modes of Data Transfer:
 * - Asynchronous: Data transmitted without a clock signal.
 * - Synchronous: Data synchronized using a clock pulse.
 *
 * Limitations:
 * - Limited data rate compared to modern serial protocols.
 * - Susceptible to noise over long distances.
 * - Requires proper voltage level conversion for TTL-based systems.
 *
 * Applications:
 * - Industrial automation and control systems.
 * - Communication between microcontrollers and external devices.
 * - Legacy computer interfaces (modems, printers, etc.).
 *
 * Summary:
 * RS232 remains a reliable serial communication standard despite newer alternatives like USB and SPI.
 * Proper implementation ensures stable data exchange between devices.
