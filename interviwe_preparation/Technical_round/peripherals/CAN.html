 * ====================================================================================

The Controller Area Network (CAN) is a robust serial communication protocol
that allows microcontrollers and electronic devices (nodes) to communicate with each 
other without a central host computer.Originally developed by Bosch for automotive 
applications to reduce wiring complexity, 
it is now a global standard used in industrial automation, medical equipment, and 
aerospace

3 Imporatant points 
Priority-Based (Arbitration): 
Not all messages are equal. CAN uses "Arbitration" to ensure that critical messages 
(like "Apply Brakes") always get through before less important ones 
(like "Temperature Update") without any data collisions.

Noise Immunity (Differential Signaling): Because it uses two wires (CAN High and Low),
it is extremely resistant to electrical noise, which is why it’s the standard 
for harsh environments like cars and factories.

Broadcast System: It works like a radio station. 
One node "broadcasts" a message, and every other node hears it. 
Each node then uses filters to decide, "Is this message meant for me?

The "Why" (The Benefit)
Reduces Wiring: Instead of running miles of point-to-point wires between every sensor, 
you just connect everything to a single "bus" (the two wires).
Reliability: It has built-in error detection. If a message is corrupted, 
the node automatically knows and tries to send it again

Interview Tip: If they ask for a real-world analogy, say:
"It’s like a group of people in a dark room. Anyone can speak when it’s quiet,
but if two people start at once, the one with the most important news keeps talking 
while the other stops to listen. Everyone hears the message, 
but only the person it concerns takes action.

-------------------------------------------------

Layers of CAN in detail explaination 
CAN Signal : physical layer
CAN uses differential signaling across two wires, CAN_H (High)
and CAN_L (Low), which provides high immunity to electromagnetic 
interference (EMI)

Differential Voltage V_diff: 
voltage difference between CAN_H and CAN_L . ( V_diff=V_CAN_H - V_CAN_L ).

Recessive Bit (Logical 1):
Voltage: Both lines are driven to a common mode voltage, typically 2.5V.
V_diff: Approximately 0V (typically < 0.5V).
Behavior: This is the idle state. If no node is transmitting a dominant bit,
the bus remains recessive

Dominant Bit (Logical 0):
Voltage: CAN_H is driven up to 3.5V, and CAN_L is driven down to 1.5V
V_diff: Approximately 2.0V.
Behavior: A dominant bit physically overrides a recessive bit. If one node sends a 
'0' while another sends a '1', the bus will reflect a '0', which is essential for 
message arbitration (from MSB to LSB )

CAN uses  Non-Return to Zero (NRZ) Coding
NRZ is a binary line code where the signal level stays constant for the entire 
duration of a bit.
Logical 0 (Dominant): The voltage level is at one state (e.g.V_diff approx 2V
for the full bit time.
Logical 1 (Recessive): The voltage level stays at the resting state V_diff approx 0V
for the full bit time.
The Advantage: It is highly efficient because it doesn't require the signal 
to "return to zero" between every bit

The Problem: Because the signal doesn't change for long strings of 0s or 1s, 
there are no "edges" (voltage transitions). Receivers rely on these edges to 
synchronize their internal clocks with the transmitter. Without edges, 
the receiver's clock might "drift,"leading it to miscount bits or lose 
the frame entirely(synchromisation is done using voltage level changes )

2. Bit Stuffing: The Solution
To fix the lack of transitions in NRZ, CAN uses bit stuffing. 
This process ensures that the signal "toggles" often enough for receivers to stay in 
sync

The Rule: Whenever the transmitter detects five consecutive bits of the same 
polarity (five 0s or five 1s) in the data stream, it automatically inserts
a sixth bit of the opposite polarity

Example:
Original Data: 1 1 1 1 1
Stuffed Stream: 1 1 1 1 1 0 (the 0 is the "stuff bit")

Syncing on the Edge: This extra bit creates a forced voltage transition (a rising 
or falling edge). Every receiver on the bus sees this transition and resets its
internal clock, ensuring it stays perfectly aligned with the transmitter.

3. Key Details
De-stuffing: The receiving node’s CAN controller automatically identifies 
and removes these extra bits after every five identical bits. The user 
software only sees the original, correct data

Where it applies: Bit stuffing is used in the Arbitration, Control, Data,
and CRC fields. It is not used in fixed-format parts like the CRC Delimiter,
ACK Slot, or End of Frame (EOF), which rely on specific fixed patterns

Stuff Errors: If a node detects six consecutive bits of the same polarity
where stuffing should have occurred, it flags a "Stuff Error," 
sends an Error Frame, and the message must be retransmitted.

Jitter: A side effect of bit stuffing is that message length 
can vary slightly based on the data content,which can introduce "jitter" 
(small timing variations) in real-time systems.

2. Transmission Medium
The medium consists of the wiring, connectors, and termination required 
to maintain signal integrity over distance

Twisted-Pair Cable: The standard requires a twisted-pair cable 
(shielded or unshielded) with a nominal characteristic impedance of 120 ohm. 
Twisting the wires ensures that external noise affects both lines equally, 
allowing the differential receiver to cancel the interference

Termination Resistors:
Value: Exactly two 120 ohm resistors must be placed at 
the extreme ends of the main bus line
Purpose: These match the cable's characteristic impedance to prevent 
signal reflections (echoes) that could distort data and cause errors.

Verification: When the network is powered off, the resistance measured 
between CAN_H and CAN_L should be approximately 60 ohm (two 120 ohm) resistors 
in parallel)

Topology: High-speed CAN typically uses a linear bus topology. 
To minimize reflections, "stubs" (branches from the main bus to individual nodes) 
should be kept as short as possible, typically \(\le \) 0.3 meters at 1 Mbps.

CAN Frame Transfer Layer :
Transfer rate and Timing 

transfer rate :
Classical CAN (CAN 2.0): Supports bit rates up to 1 Mbps. 
Common speeds include 
125 kbps, 250 kbps, and 500 kbps (standard for most automotive networks)

CAN FD (Flexible Data-Rate):arbitration phase remains at 1 Mbps,
the data phase can reach up to 5–8 Mbps

CAN XL: The newest generation supports data rates up to 20 Mbps

Distance Trade-off: Higher bit rates require shorter bus lengths. 
For example, 1 Mbps is limited to roughly 40 meters, 
while 125 kbps can operate over 500 meters

Important term Time Quantum :
the Time Quantum (TQ) remains the fundamental, 
non-divisible unit of time that defines the resolution of a single CAN bit. 
It serves as the "clock tick" for the CAN controller to build and manage the
bit timing segments

Definition and Calculation:
TQ is derived from the peripheral clock of the microcontroller (MCU) by applying
a Baud Rate Prescaler (BRP). The prescaler slows down the high-frequency system
clock to a manageable speed for the CAN protocol.

The standard formula is:
TQ = BRP / System clock freq = 4 / 40 MHz = 100ns
Sigle bit  = 8 to 25 TQs;
1.Sync_Seg: Always exactly 1 TQ.
2.Prop_Seg, Phase_Seg1, and Phase_Seg2: These are programmable and consist of a 
specific number of TQs (e.g., 4 TQ for Prop_Seg, 5 TQ for Phase_Seg1).

FRAM FORMATE 
1.SOF (Start of Frame): 1 dominant bit to synchronize all nodes.
2.Arbitration Field
  ->Identifier: 11 bits (Standard) 
  ->RTR (Remote Transmission Request): 
  Dominant for data, recessive for requesting data
3.Control Field:
  ->Contains the IDE bit
  ->1 reserved bit 
  ->DLC (Data Length Code)
4.Data Field: 0 to 8 bytes of data.
5.CRC Field: 15-bit cyclic redundancy check for error detection.
 ->0 to 14 CRC 
 ->CRC delimeter -> 1 
6.ACK Field:  
 -> ack ->0
 -> ack delimiter-> 1
7.EOF (End of Frame): 7 recessive (1) bits marking the frame's conclusion
8.IFS (INTER FRAM SPACE 3 BITS -> 1)

Arbitration:
nodes transmit their identifiers 
bit by bit(MSB TO LSB). NODE 1 -> 0001 AND NODE 2 -> 0011 -> WINNER NODE1
If a node transmitting a "1" detects a "0" from another node, it stops 
transmitting, recognizing that the other node has a higher priority. This
process ensures that the message with the highest priority (the lowest ID)
successfully gets through without collisions or data los

->massege validation 
If any node on the bus detects an error during these checks, 
it "destroys" the message by sending an Error Frame, forcing the transmitter
to try again

The five primary validation checks are:
1.CRC Check: The receiver calculates its own checksum 
from the data and compares it to the CRC Field sent by the transmitter.
2.Bit Stuffing Check: If the receiver sees more than 5 consecutive bits of 
the same level (000000 or 111111),it flags a "stuffing error," as the 6th 
bit must always 
be an opposite "stuff" bit for synchronization
3.Form Check: The receiver ensures "fixed-form" fields—like the CRC Delimiter, 
ACK Delimiter,and EOF—are correctly sent as Recessive (1) bits
4.ACK Check: The transmitter sends a Recessive bit in the ACK Slot; if it 
doesn't "hear" a Dominant bit back from at least one receiver, it declares 
the message invalid
5.Bit Monitoring: The transmitter "listens" to every bit it sends. If it 
sends a 1 but sees a 0 (outside of the arbitration or ACK phases), it 
signals a bit error.

->Fault Confinement
Every node maintains two internal counters: the Transmit Error Counter (TEC) and 
the Receive Error Counter (REC). Based on these values, a node exists in one of 
three states:
1. Error Active (Healthy)
Condition: Both TEC and REC are less than 128.
Behavior: The node participates fully. If it detects an error, 
it sends a Dominant Error Flag (6 dominant bits) : means to stop all bus traffic 
and force a retransmission
2. Error Passive (Suspect)
Condition: Either TEC or REC exceeds 127.
Behavior: The node is "put on probation." When it detects an error, 
it can only send a Recessive Error Flag. means it will not send data only 
error will get send stilllistern everything Additionally, it must wait for 
an extra "Suspend Transmission" time before sending its next message
3.Bus Off (The "Banned" Stage):
If the device keeps failing (counter over 255), it is considered totally broken. 
The system "kicks it off" the bus entirely. It is forced to stay silent and stop 
talking so the rest of the network can keep working smoothly without interference.

->1. Message Filtering (Acceptance Filtering)
Message filtering happens in the hardware of the CAN controller. This allows the 
controller to automatically discard irrelevant messages without waking up the
main CPU Filter Masks & IDs: You configure "Acceptance Masks" 
and "Acceptance Filters."
->Filter ID: The specific ID you are looking for (e.g., 0x123).
->Filter Mask: Tells the hardware which bits of the ID to ignore. 
For example, a mask could tell the controller to "only look at the first 3 bits" of 
an ID
Benefits: This ensures that if a car has 100 different messages flying across the bus, 
the Engine Control Unit (ECU) only "sees" the 5 messages it actually needs to operate, 
improving 2025 system efficiency. [1, 2]

->2. Message and Status Handling
Message Buffering:
Transmit Mailboxes: Your software places a message in a "mailbox." 
The Object Layer then handles the timing and arbitration to send it out.

Receive FIFOs: Incoming messages that pass the filter are stored in a First-In-First-Out 
(FIFO) buffer until the CPU is ready to read them.

Status Reporting:
Transmission Status: The layer notifies the software if a message was 
"Sent Successfully,""Failed due to Arbitration loss," or "Failed due to Error."
Error Tracking: It reports the current status of the Fault Confinement counters 
(TEC and REC) so the software knows if the node is in Error Active, Error Passive, 
or Bus Off state. [3, 4]
