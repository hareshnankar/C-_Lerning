/* 🧠 Prerequisites for Learning Modbus TCP */

/* 🌐 Networking Basics:
 * - Understand how IP addresses and ports work
 * - Know the difference between client and server models
 * - Basics of TCP/IP communication (packets, sockets, handshakes)
 */

/* 🧱 Protocol Fundamentals:
 * - What is a communication protocol?
 * - How request-response cycles work
 * - Frame structure and byte-level data formats
 */

/* 🔧 Programming Readiness:
 * - Basic coding skills (preferably in C, Python, or Java)
 * - How to use libraries and install packages
 * - Debugging tools (Wireshark, Modbus simulators)
 */

/* 🧪 Embedded / Automation Context (if applicable):
 * - What PLCs and field devices are
 * - Digital vs analog signals
 * - Industrial use of registers (for sensors, actuators)
 */

/* 📘 Optional Knowledge Boost:
 * - Hexadecimal and binary number systems
 * - Little-endian vs big-endian data formats
 * - Basics of CRC and TCP checksum
 */

/* ✅ Goal:
 * Be ready to understand how Modbus TCP wraps Modbus commands inside Ethernet packets,
 * how devices talk over the network, and how to interpret register data logically.
